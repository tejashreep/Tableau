Data Visualization: Does my vote matter?
Project description'Does my vote matter?' is a tableau story that analyzes whether every citizen's vote matters in US Elections or not .It compares methodologies used in counting votes. The story moves around the counting technique used in Nebraska and Maine where the candidate gets the votes of only those counties in which they have won unlike other US states where the policy of 'Winner takes all' is applied. If the former technique is applied to all US states we conclude that there is no considerable difference in results. Also, it highlights voter turnout and the concept of swing states that dramatically changed the election results. The story concludes by saying that had the percentage of voter turnout been a little higher then the picture would have been different.
